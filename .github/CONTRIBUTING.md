# Contributing
Neon has a number of open source projects and we welcome community involvement. 
We want to provide ways for everyone to contribute where they can, while keeping
our releases on track and maintaining a high-quality code base.

## How to Help Out
Here are a few ways you can contribute to making Neon better, no matter your 
technical abilities.

### Testing
Depending on your technical ability, this can mean anything from reporting 
"I asked for the weather and got this weird response" to writing unit test 
coverage for a skill or module. If you're familiar with GitHub and know which 
repository a bug belongs to, feel free to open an issue there; otherwise, the 
[openconversational.ai forums](https://community.openconversational.ai) are a 
great place to post questions or issues to get some help. 

### Translation
If you are fluent or even barely-conversational in a language other than 
English, you can probably help with translating a skill to work in other 
languages. We are working on a place to track what needs translation, but until 
then feel free to reach out and ask where you can help out.

### Bounty Projects
We have a [bounty board](https://github.com/orgs/NeonGeckoCom/projects/12/views/1)
of projects that we'd love to see completed but don't have the resources to 
complete right now. These are generally bigger projects that will require some 
collaboration with the Neon AI team and that come with some kind of reward or 
compensation. If there's a project on the board that you think you can take on, 
message NeonDaniel or NeonClary to work out the details.

### Help Wanted Issues
If you have some Python skills but don't want to take on a full project from our
bounty board, check out any of our open issues with the "help wanted" tag (also 
listed on our [bounty board](https://github.com/orgs/NeonGeckoCom/projects/12/views/1)).
These are usually pretty small bugs or modifications that need to be addressed; 
requirements for a particular Issue will be outlined in the issue. You can comment 
on any open issue to ask clarifying questions or to get some suggestions for how to start.

### Feature Requests
If there's something that you want to see from a Neon project that isn't there, 
feel free to open a "Feature Request" Issue or post in the 
[openconversational.ai forums](https://community.openconversational.ai). We 
can't promise everything will make it onto our roadmap, but some great improvements
have made it into Neon because a user wanted something, worked out the implementation
details with us, and then contributed the feature they wanted.

### Documentation
Sometimes we find things that would have been a lot easier to figure out if they
were just written down somewhere, or maybe you spent some time getting something
working *just right* after some trial and error. Posting in the 
[openconversational.ai forums](https://community.openconversational.ai) is a 
great way to share your discoveries so that we may all benefit from your efforts.
Alternatively, if you find something in
[our docs](https://neongeckocom.github.io/neon-docs/) that was unclear, incorrect,
or incomplete then please do [open an issue](https://github.com/NeonGeckoCom/neon-docs/issues)
or PR some changes to make it better.

## Expectations and Requirements
We want to encourage anyone to contribute how they can, so this part is short.

- Licensing: Any contributions will carry the license that exists on the 
  repository they are contributed to.
- Deadlines: You tell us; some issues will need to be resolved before the next 
  release, so we might ask someone who started on something to let someone else 
  take over if they run out of time. For bounty projects we will try to ballpark
  a timeline when you start but won't hold you to a firm due date.
- Code Reviews: Any contribution will be subject to a review before it is 
  accepted; part of the job is addressing any concerns raised by the reviewer. 
  The review process is 
  [documented here](https://neongeckocom.github.io/neon-docs/operations/libraries/workflow_review_alpha/).
  > Don't be scared off by this, we just want to make sure changes work as expected with reasonable test coverage.
